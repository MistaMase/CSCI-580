## Matrix and Vector Helper Functions
In rend.h, I defined additional private helper functions for vector and matrix operations. These include, and are not limited to, normalization, vector cross product, and vector subtraction. The matrix and vector operations are written generically, ideally so future projects that require matrix and vector support may use the same functions. While I normally try to one-line any functions in the header, in the case of matrix-matrix multiplication and matrix-vector multiplication, the math gets a bit wild and this required a few more lines.
