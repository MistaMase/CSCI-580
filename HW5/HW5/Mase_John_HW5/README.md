## Procedural Textures
I've added two different procedudral textures, a checkerboard and Sierpinski carpet. Both run through the ptex_fun function pointer, except a compiler directive can be toggled within ptex_fun within tex_fun.cpp. To run the checkerboard texture, simply change the ```#if X``` value to ```#if 0```. To run the Sierpinski carpet, simply change the ```#if X``` value to ```#if 1```.
